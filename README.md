•	Consulted with a team of two to create a website for a non-profit organization that supports incarcerated women to bring awareness to their cause, raise donations, and describe future events.
•	Coded and designed the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enable users to make a donation, volunteer, receive event notifications, and learn more about the women impacted by incarceration.
